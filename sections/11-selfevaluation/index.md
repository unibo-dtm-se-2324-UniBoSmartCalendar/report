# Self-evaluation

## Giulia

### Role and contributions
During the development of **UniBo Smart Calendar**, I mainly worked as Frontend Architect & UI/UX contributor. My work focused on building the user-facing layer and ensuring that the application was usable, navigable, and consistent with the required features.

Concretely, my main contributions were:
- **Project scaffold and baseline setup**: client structure, initial configuration, and ensuring the project could run and build correctly.
- **UI shell implementation**: including the main navigation structure and the core interface components (calendar view container, filters, and base pages such as settings/notifications/statistics where applicable).

### Strengths of my work (and of the product, from my perspective)
- **User-centered structure:** I contributed to a clear UI flow (from adding timetables to visualizing and filtering the schedule), which makes the application approachable for students.
- **Feature completeness at UI level:** the project offers a coherent interface for calendar visualization, filtering, conflict awareness, and interoperability features (export/subscription), which are the main user-visible outcomes.
- **Collaboration and integration mindset:** contributing to merges and keeping the UI consistent with shared utilities/services helped reduce integration issues late in the project.

### Weaknesses / areas for improvement
In my opinion, the user interface could be made smoother and even more intuitive, i.e. clearer loading states, error feedback, and more guided feedback for incorrect inputs.

### What I learned
This project strengthened my ability to design and implement a non-trivial React-based UI with modular components and service integration, to manage a codebase and contribute effectively to shared integration branches, and to reason about usability constraints (filters, conflicts, navigation) and translate them into implementable UI behavior.

### Final reflection
I particularly enjoyed working on this project because it aligned well with my interest in a user-centered perspective, which is consistent with my academic background. Moreover, my internship experience, where I worked with Jira and had responsibilities similar to a Product Owner (e.g., managing issues, aligning features to user needs, and structuring work into clear deliverables), made the UI/UX and interaction design aspects especially engaging. This project allowed me to apply that mindset directly to a concrete product.
Overall, I believe my contribution was consistent with my role: delivering a functional and navigable frontend, supporting the project baseline, and ensuring integration stability. Given more time, I would focus on improving UX details (feedback, accessibility, responsiveness).
